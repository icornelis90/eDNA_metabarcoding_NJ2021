## eDNA metabarcoding Bioinformatics Offshore wind farm monitoring with eDNA
### Description
These scripts were used for the data anlysis of the seawater samples collected in autumn 2021. 
Amplification was performed with a one-step PCR-protocol using uniquely tagged primersets for each sample. Sequencing was done on a MiSeq illumina platform.
Detailed information about the scripts and how to use them can be found in the document **eDNAmetabarcoding_DataAnalysis_Workflow_MiSeq.docx**

### Step0_fastqc.sh
Script can be used for the quality control of the raw sequencing reads after downloading.
The script will return the FastQC report for each file seperately and the MultiQC report.
